    <h1>Core Memorie</h1> 
    <p>One childhood memorie I have was at my old school. 
        when I fell over a small ledge and my face landed on concrete. 
        What happened was that me and my freinds were jumping over a ledge 
        and so I tried. It did not go well. I tripped over the ledge 
        and landed face first from 5 feet in the air. The next thing 
        I remember was that my cousins were helping me to the office 
        because we were all in the same class and then my mom being 
        there and showing me the picture of how I looked with a bunch 
        of blood and bandages on my face.</p>
